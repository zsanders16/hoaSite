                  Woodstock Village is a Planned Unit Development (PUD) ideally located within a short distance from public 
                  transportation, schools, churches, shopping, recreation and interstate highways. 
                  <br />
                  <br />
                  It was developed in 1977 and consists of 103 single family homes with small lots and a zero lot line concept. 
                  It is officially annexed by Murray City but remains in the Granite School District boundaries. Prior to its 
                  development, it was a small golf course and practice range. 
                  <br />
                  <br />
                  In order to maintain the integrity of the neighborhood and protect our homeownersâ€™ investment, there are 
                  reasonable restrictive covenants which are enforced by an elected association board. There is a small yearly 
                  assessment to pay for decorative street lighting and common areas. Woodstock Village also constructed a secure 
                  recreational vehicle storage area to rent at a reasonable monthly fee on a space available basis. 
                  <br />
